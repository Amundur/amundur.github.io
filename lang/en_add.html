        <p class="text">Hello!<br>
            If you want to help me by translating Amundur into another language, first thank you very much for taking the time to bring this game to your language so that more people can enjoy it in their language.<br>
            To add a new location to the game, you must send me an email to the following address: anderromeroaldana@gmail.com, explaining which language you want to translate it, how much time is going to take to you to translate it aproximately and whatever you want.<br>
            I'll answer you as soon as I can.</p>
